<div class="_1l1MA" data-track-load="description_content"><p>Table: <code>Cinema</code></p>

<pre>+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| id             | int      |
| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |
+----------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not <code>"boring"</code>.</p>

<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>rating</code> <strong>in descending order</strong>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> 
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.

### Notes
- ``=`` worst case complexity O(N) where N is length of the string. And is used to compare two values for inequality.
- ``like`` is is used to perform pattern matching on strings. the worst case complexity is O(N^2) However, many modern database management systems have optimized regular expression engines that can perform pattern matching in linear time, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
