<pre>+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |

+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a factory website that has several machines each running the <strong>same number of processes</strong>. Write an SQL query to find the <strong>average time</strong> each machine takes to complete a process.</p>

<p>The time to complete a process is the <code>'end' timestamp</code> minus the <code>'start' timestamp</code>. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.</p>

<p>The resulting table should have the <code>machine_id</code> along with the <strong>average time</strong> as <code>processing_time</code>, which should be <strong>rounded to 3 decimal places</strong>.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>

Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |

<strong>Output:</strong>

| 2          | 1.456           |
+------------+-----------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456

### Notes
- Just take advantage of ``join`` with same table. 
- ``round(float_number, 3)`` is a window function and supported by most DBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite)
- There are alternative functions to the `ROUND` function in SQL that you can use depending on your specific requirements. Here are some examples:
    1. `CEILING`: This function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the specified numeric expression. It is often used to round up a value. For example, `CEILING(3.14)` would return 4.
    2. `FLOOR`: This function returns the largest integer less than or equal to the specified numeric expression. It is often used to round down a value. For example, `FLOOR(3.99)` would return 3.
    3. `TRUNCATE`: This function truncates a numeric expression to a specified number of decimal places. Unlike `ROUND`, `TRUNCATE` simply removes the digits beyond the specified decimal point without any rounding. For example, `TRUNCATE(3.14159, 2)` would return 3.14.
    4. `CAST`: This is not a rounding function, but it can be used to convert a numeric value to a specified data type with a specified precision. For example, `CAST(3.14159 AS DECIMAL(4,2))` would return 3.14.
    Keep in mind that the syntax and behavior of these functions may vary between different SQL implementations.
