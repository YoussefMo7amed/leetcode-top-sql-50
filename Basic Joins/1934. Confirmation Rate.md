| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
user_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.

<p>Table: <code>Confirmations</code></p>

<pre>+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
| action         | ENUM     |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key for this table.
user_id is a foreign key with a reference to the Signups table.
action is an ENUM of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>confirmation rate</strong> of a user is the number of <code>'confirmed'</code> messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is <code>0</code>. Round the confirmation rate to <strong>two decimal</strong> places.</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to find the <strong>confirmation rate</strong> of each user.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>

Signups table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | time_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 |

<strong>Output:</strong>

| 2       | 0.50              |
+---------+-------------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.

1. 
Convert the problem into several subproblem..
    - we need to know number ``confirmed`` and ``timeout``, we did that by extracting them and add them as new columns in ``sub`` table
    - we know if the ``confirmed`` = 0 then ``confirmation_rate`` is also 0, that's inside ``case``
    - Now we know there are some users did not request any confirmation messages like user with id 6 in first example. we need to join them with the previous table. Here we use ``right join``, of course you can use ``left`` and replace their order.
```sql
select
    s.user_id,
    coalesce(
        case
            when confirmed = 0 then 0.00
            else round(confirmed / (timeout + confirmed), 2)
        end,
        0
    ) as confirmation_rate
from
    (
        select
            user_id,
            sum(
                case
                    when action = 'confirmed' then 1
                    else 0
                end
            ) as confirmed,
            sum(
                case
                    when action = 'timeout' then 1
                    else 0
                end
            ) as timeout
        from
            Confirmations
        group by
            user_id
    ) sub
    right join Signups s on s.user_id = sub.user_id
group by
    user_id
```

2. 
From Leetcode solutions
```sql 
select
    s.user_id,
    round(avg(if(c.action = "confirmed", 1, 0)), 2) as confirmation_rate
from
    Signups as s
    left join Confirmations as c on s.user_id = c.user_id
group by
    user_id;
```

### Notes
- Take advantage of ``CASE``
- ``if`` Another way to perform conditional logic in SQL is to use the IF function, which is supported by some DBMS
```sql
SELECT column1, column2,
       IF(column3 > 0, 'Positive', IF(column3 < 0, 'Negative', 'Zero or null')) as column3_type
FROM your_table;
```
In this query, we use the IF function to check the value of column3 for each row in your_table. If column3 is greater than 0, we return the string 'Positive'. If column3 is less than 0, we return the string 'Negative'. Otherwise, if column3 is 0 or null, we return the string 'Zero or null'.

Note that the IF function may not be supported by all DBMS, and the syntax may vary depending on the specific DBMS you are using. If the IF function is not available, you can use the CASE statement, which is supported by most DBMS.
MySql and SQLite support it, while PostgreSQL doesn't.
