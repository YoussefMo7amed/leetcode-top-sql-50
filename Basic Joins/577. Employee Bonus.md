### Notes

- "LEFT OUTER JOIN" could be written as "LEFT JOIN".
- Don't forget to add ``column is null`` otherwise it won't be selected.
- The ``COALESCE`` function 
    - It returns the first non-NULL expression in the list of expressions passed as arguments. If all expressions evaluate to NULL, then NULL is returned. It's supported by most DBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite)
    - The ``COALESCE`` function was introduced as part of the SQL-92 standard, and its name has been widely adopted by database management systems that support the SQL standard.
    - at the ``COALESCE`` function is similar to the ``IFNULL`` function in some database management systems, which also returns the first non-NULL expression in a list of expressions. However, ``COALESCE`` is more flexible, as it can take any number of expressions as input, whereas ``IFNULL`` takes exactly two expressions.
