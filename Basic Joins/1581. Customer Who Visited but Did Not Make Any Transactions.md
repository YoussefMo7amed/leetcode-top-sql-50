<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

1. 
``` sql
select
    v.customer_id,
    count(v.visit_id) as count_no_trans
from
    Visits v
    left outer join transactions t on v.visit_id = t.visit_id
where
    t.visit_id is null
group by
    customer_id
```

2. 

``` sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    COUNT(visit_id) as count_no_trans
FROM
    Visits
WHERE
    visit_id NOT IN (
        SELECT
            visit_id
        FROM
            Transactions
    )
GROUP BY
    customer_id
```

### Notes
- You can use the difference between 2 tables using one of these patters:


``` SQL
SELECT table1.key_column
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.key_column = table2.key_column
WHERE table2.key_column IS NULL;
```
or

``` SQL
SELECT table1.key_column
FROM table1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT *
  FROM table2
  WHERE table2.key_column = table1.key_column
);
```

- You can also use ``EXCEPT``

``` SQL
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table2;

```
but it's not applicable here.
